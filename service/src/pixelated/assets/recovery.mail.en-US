Why is this so important?

Pixelated is an email client that respects your privacy and uses PGP Encryption to do so. Your password also gives you access to your keys, so if you forget it you will lose access to your account and the ability to read your messages.
Forgetting passwords is a common thing, so we developed a more secure way to recover access to your account.

1) This code is half of a big code to recover your account.
2) The other half is with the account administrator.
3) In case you forget your password, use this code and your administrator code to recover access to your account. It's like those locks with two keys :)



PS: If you didn't create an account at https://{domain}, please ignore this email.
